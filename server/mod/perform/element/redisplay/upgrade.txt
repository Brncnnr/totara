=== 16.0 ===

* Redisplay elements can now have missing records in the perform_section_element_reference table when the source activity
  is deleted. To account for that, the performelement_redisplay\redisplay::post_update() method will no longer throw
  an exception when the redisplay element does not have a record in perform_section_element_reference. Instead, it will
  create a new one.
