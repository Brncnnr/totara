Web API is a framework for implementing different types of web services in Totara.

Web API is described by a GraphQL schema, resolvers are implemented
as PHP classes in webapi component namespaces and web service end-points
may use GraphQL persisted queries stored in webapi subdirectories.

See the developer documentation for more information on the available services,
using the API, and developing for it:
