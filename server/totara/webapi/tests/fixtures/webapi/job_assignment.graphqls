Bogus job assignment type to make schema_files_test happy.
Why? Because the schema loader is looking in this directory for plugin schema, but still looks in server/lib/webapi
for core schema. So it loads core_user, which depends on totara_job_job_assignment, but it doesn't find that type
anywhere else because it is no longer looking in $pluginname/webapi but in $pluginname/test/fixtures/webapi.
